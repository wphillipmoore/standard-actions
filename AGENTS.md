# Standard Actions Agent Instructions

**Standards reference**: <https://github.com/wphillipmoore/standards-and-conventions>
— active standards documentation lives in the standard-tooling repository under `docs/`.
Repository profile: `standard-tooling.toml`.

## User Overrides (Optional)

If `~/AGENTS.md` exists and is readable, load it and apply it as a
user-specific overlay for this session. If it cannot be read, say so
briefly and continue.

## Canonical Standards

This repository follows the canonical standards and conventions in the
`standards-and-conventions` repository.

Resolve the local path (preferred):

- `../standards-and-conventions`

If the local path is unavailable, use the canonical web source:

- <https://github.com/wphillipmoore/standards-and-conventions>

If the canonical standards cannot be retrieved, treat it as a fatal
exception and stop.

## Shared Skills

Replace `<standards-repo-path>` with the resolved local path when available.

- Load all skills from: `<standards-repo-path>/skills/**/SKILL.md`
- Treat every skill found under that directory as available and active.

## Local Overrides

None.
