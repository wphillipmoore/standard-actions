# Security Scanning

## Overview

Three security scanning tools provide layered coverage:

| Tool | Purpose | Output |
| ------ | --------- | -------- |
| [CodeQL](../actions/security-codeql.md) | GitHub-native SAST with deep semantic analysis | SARIF uploaded to code scanning |
| [Semgrep](../actions/security-semgrep.md) | Fast pattern-based SAST with community rulesets | SARIF uploaded to code scanning |
| [Trivy](../actions/security-trivy.md) | Dependency vulnerability scanning and SBOM generation | SARIF uploaded to code scanning |

## GHAS requirements

All three tools upload results in SARIF format to GitHub Code Scanning, which
requires **GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)**:

- **Public repositories** — GHAS is available by default at no cost.
- **Private repositories** — A GHAS license is required. Contact your GitHub
  administrator.

## Check names in the PR status area

Each security scanner produces **two** check runs on a pull request:

| CI workflow job | SARIF analysis check |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| `security: codeql` | `CodeQL` |
| `security: semgrep` | `Semgrep OSS` |
| `security: trivy` | `Trivy` |

The first column shows our CI workflow jobs — these are the checks gated in the
[CI gates ruleset](repository-rulesets.md#ci-gates-ruleset). The second column
shows checks that GitHub creates automatically when SARIF results are uploaded
via the `security-events: write` permission. The SARIF analysis checks are
informational and are **not** included in the required status checks.

## Viewing results

Security scan results appear in the repository's **Security** tab:

1. Navigate to **Security > Code scanning alerts**.
2. Filter by tool: `CodeQL`, `semgrep`, or `trivy-fs` / `trivy-image`.
3. Each alert shows the affected file, line number, severity, and a description
   of the finding.

## CodeQL

CodeQL performs deep semantic analysis of source code. It understands data flow,
control flow, and language-specific patterns.

- **Languages supported**: Python, Go, Ruby, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and more.
- **Query suite**: `+security-extended` (default) includes the standard security
  queries plus extended checks.
- **Autobuild**: CodeQL automatically detects the build system and compiles the
  project.

```yaml
- uses: wphillipmoore/standard-actions/actions/security/codeql@develop
  with:
    language: python
```

## Semgrep

Semgrep provides fast, pattern-based static analysis with a large library of
community-maintained rules.

Default rulesets enabled for every scan:

- `p/<language>` — Language-specific security rules
- `p/security-audit` — Cross-cutting security audit rules
- `p/secrets` — Secret detection (API keys, tokens, passwords)

Additional rulesets can be added via `extra-config`:

```yaml
- uses: wphillipmoore/standard-actions/actions/security/semgrep@develop
  with:
    language: golang
    extra-config: "p/owasp-top-ten"
```

## Trivy

Trivy scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and container images.

### Scan modes

| Mode | Use case | SARIF category |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| `fs` | Scan project dependencies for known CVEs | `trivy-fs` |
| `image` | Scan container images for OS and library CVEs | `trivy-image` |
| `sbom` | Generate CycloneDX SBOM (no SARIF upload) | — |

### Severity filtering

By default, only `CRITICAL` and `HIGH` severity vulnerabilities are reported.
This can be adjusted:

```yaml
- uses: wphillipmoore/standard-actions/actions/security/trivy@develop
  with:
    scan-type: fs
    severity: "CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM"
```

### Exit code behavior

By default, Trivy exits with code `1` when vulnerabilities are found, failing
the CI check. Set `exit-code: "0"` for advisory-only mode:

```yaml
- uses: wphillipmoore/standard-actions/actions/security/trivy@develop
  with:
    scan-type: fs
    exit-code: "0"
```

## Workflow permissions

All security scanning jobs require the `security-events: write` permission:

```yaml
jobs:
  codeql:
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      contents: read
```
