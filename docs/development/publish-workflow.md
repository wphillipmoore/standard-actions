# Publish workflow ordering

Each consuming repository has a `publish.yml` workflow that runs on push to
`main`. While the specific build, publish, and version-bump steps are
language-specific, the **ordering of phases** must be consistent across all
repositories.

## Canonical step order

```text
1. Checkout + language setup
2. Extract version from source
3. Check if tag already exists          (idempotency gate)
4. Check if already on public registry  (idempotency gate, language-specific)
5. Build and validate
6. Attest build provenance
7. Generate SBOM
8. Tag and release                      (GitHub tag + release with artifacts)
9. Publish to public registry           (optional, gated on credentials)
10. Version bump PR                     (bumps version on develop)
```

## Why this order matters

Steps 1-8 use only GitHub-native capabilities (tags, releases, attestations)
and shared actions. They must always succeed when a new version is merged to
main.

Step 9 (publishing to PyPI, Maven Central, RubyGems, etc.) depends on external
credentials and services. If it runs before tagging:

- A registry outage or credential issue blocks the entire release pipeline
- No tag is created, so the docs site has no release content
- No version bump PR is filed, so develop falls out of sync
- The SBOM is never generated or attached to a release

By placing the registry publish **after** the tag, the release is recorded in
GitHub regardless of whether the external publish succeeds. The publish step
can be re-run manually or the next push to main will pick it up via the
idempotency gates.

## Gating the registry publish step

The publish step should be gated on **both** the idempotency check (is this
version already published?) and credential availability:

```yaml
# Secret-based credentials (Ruby, Java)
- name: Publish to RubyGems
  if: steps.gem_check.outputs.status == 'not_found' && secrets.RUBYGEMS_API_KEY != ''
  env:
    GEM_HOST_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.RUBYGEMS_API_KEY }}
  run: gem push dist/my-gem-${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}.gem

# OIDC trusted publishing (Python)
- name: Publish to PyPI
  if: steps.pypi_check.outputs.status == 'not_found'
  uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
```

For languages using OIDC trusted publishing (Python/PyPI), the secret gate is
not needed because the action uses GitHub's built-in OIDC provider.

For languages using explicit API keys or credentials, gate on the secret so that
repositories without credentials configured can still tag releases and file
version bump PRs.

## Go exception

Go modules are published by pushing a tag — there is no separate publish step.
The Go workflow naturally has the correct order because `tag-and-release` is the
publish mechanism.

## Idempotency gates

Every step should be safe to re-run. The two gates ensure this:

- **Tag check**: Skips everything if the tag already exists (the release was
  already created on a previous run)
- **Registry check**: Skips the publish step if the version is already on the
  public registry (avoids duplicate publish errors)

Build, attest, and SBOM steps should be gated on `tag_check` (not the registry
check) because these artifacts are needed for the GitHub release regardless of
registry status.
