## Purpose

Provide a centralized, versioned set of GitHub Actions that can be reused across
application and library repositories without workflow drift.

## Branching and releases

- `develop` is the integration branch.
- Release branches are named `release/<version>` (e.g., `release/1.4.1`).
- Releases are tagged on `main` after the release PR merges.

## Versioning

- Repository-level SemVer tags (for example, `v1`, `v1.2.0`).
- Consumers must pin actions by tag or commit SHA.

## Validation

```
